# Among Us Simulation

This project simulates games of *Among Us* using real player stats from the Sidemen Plus channel on YouTube, where the Sidemen play *Among Us*. The goal is to analyze the probabilities of imposters or crewmates winning under different conditions. The data used in this simulation comes from an external GitHub repository, and this project builds upon that dataset.

## Features
- Simulates a standard *Among Us* game (2 imposters, rest crewmates).  
- Players perform actions based on real historical stats from the Sidemen Plus channel.  
- Tracks wins/losses for statistical analysis.  
- Randomized voting logic based on probability distributions.  

### Future Plans
- Add advanced roles (Jesters, Lovers, Engineers, etc.).
- Implement different *Among Us* maps and game settings.  
- Improve AI for more realistic player behavior.  
- Visualize game results with charts and graphs.  

## Data Source 

The player statistics used in this simulation come from [sidemen-AmongUsStats](https://github.com/Abe-neazer/sidemen-AmongUs-stats) by **Abeneazer Getachew Abeneazer**.  
All credit for data collection and compilation goes to them. This project builds upon their dataset to create a simulation of *Among Us* games.

### Sidemen Plus Channel
The gameplay data for this simulation is based on the *Sidemen Plus* YouTube channel, where the Sidemen play *Among Us* with various game modes and dynamics. The simulation mimics their gameplay style, with realistic behavior and interactions.
